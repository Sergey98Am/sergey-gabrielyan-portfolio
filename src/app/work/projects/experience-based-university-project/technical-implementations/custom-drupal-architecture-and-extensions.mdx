## Overview

Built and extended Drupal functionality with custom and contributed modules, event subscribers, and patches, carefully selecting contributed modules from Drupal.org.

## Contributed Modules Usage

The project uses a carefully selected set of contributed modules to handle content structure, relationships, filtering, and user experience:

## Custom Module Development

Several custom modules were created to keep related functionality together and avoid creating many small modules.

**serggab_common**

Created as a shared utility module to handle cross-project functionality instead of creating many small single-purpose modules.
