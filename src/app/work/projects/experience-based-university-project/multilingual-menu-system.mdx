title: "Multilingual Menu System"
---

Implemented a flexible multilingual navigation system using a **separate-menu structure** for each language (English & Armenian). This approach provides full control over menu content and hierarchy per language, without relying on translation settings or forced synchronization.

**What Implemented:**

- **Dedicated Menus Per Language:**
  - Main Navigation (English)
  - Main Navigation (Armenian)
  - Secondary Navigation (English)
  - Secondary Navigation (Armenian)
- **Independent Navigation Logic:**
    Each language can have its own number of menu items, ordering, and structure — without being required to mirror another language. This also helps when certain words do not have a direct translation.
- **Improved UX for Native Users:**
    Enables language-specific wording and a natural navigation flow, resulting in better usability and a localized browsing experience.
