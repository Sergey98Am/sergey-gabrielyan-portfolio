title: "Reusable Components System"
---

Implemented a robust set of reusable Drupal Paragraph components that allow editors to build pages using flexible, drag-and-drop blocks. Some components support optional settings such as custom heading size and background color, giving editors design flexibility without requiring theme changes.

**What Implemented:**

- **Core Paragraph Features**
  - Customizable heading size
  - Background color options
  - Flexible drag-and-drop layout control
  - Rich media support (images, videos, text)
  - Consistent styling across all components
- **Components (Drupal Paragraphs)**
  - **Accordion → Accordion Item**\
    Expandable sections for organizing structured content.
  - **Block**\
    Allows placing any Drupal block inside a paragraph and choosing its position — providing layout control.
  - **Cards → Card**\
    Standard card layouts for text and images.
  - **Cards – Overlay → Card – Overlay**\
    Displays text **on the card image** (overlay effect).
  - **Carousel – Multi AutoWidth → Carousel – Multi AutoWidth – Item**\
    Keeps the aspect ratio of images while maintaining a consistent height.
  - **Carousel – Split → Carousel – Split – Item**\
    Carousel split into two 50/50 parts — one side is text and the other is an image, with the ability to swap sides (left ↔ right).
  - **Counter → Counter Item**\
    Shows numbers (e.g., achievements or quantities) that animate upwards when scrolled into view.
  - **Fixed Scroll Effect → Fixed Scroll Effect – Item**\
    When the paragraph is reached, the background is fixed, and as items (cards) scroll, the background updates to match the active card.
  - **Links with Media**\
    One side contains text with links, and the other side shows an image or video — similar to a split layout.
  - **Logos → Logo**\
    Logos carousel with autoplay and the ability to pause it.
  - **Quick Links**\
    A small block with a list of useful links — helpful for highlighting important actions or frequently used pages.
  - **Tabs → Tab**\
    Tabs component where each tab can contain its own text block, cards, or card overlay content.
  - **Testimonials → Testimonial**\
    Testimonials carousel, each with text and an image.
  - **Text Block**\
    Text block with image editing support (CKEditor). The purpose of this paragraph is to allow text content to be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page.
  - **Text with Media**\
    Text with image or video, with the ability to swap sides.
  - **View Block**\
    Ability to place ready-made blocks (such as News, Events, etc. — Drupal View blocks) inside the layout to allow dragging and dropping.
