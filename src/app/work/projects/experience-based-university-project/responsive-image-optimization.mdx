title: "Responsive Image Optimization"
---

Implemented a performance-focused system using **Drupal Responsive Image Styles** to deliver optimized and responsive images across different devices. This allows the browser to choose the most appropriate image based on screen size, which reduces data usage and improves loading speed.

**What Implemented:**

- **Art Direction:** Applied differently cropped images based on device size (desktop vs. mobile) in the following cases:
  - Cards – screenshot, link
  - Sliders – screenshot, link
  - Hero banners – screenshot, link
- **Resolution Switching:** Rendered the same image aspect ratio in different resolutions across various devices in the following cases:
  - Cards – screenshot, link
  - Sliders – screenshot, link
  - Hero banners – screenshot, link
- **WebP Converting:** Converted images to WebP format to reduce file size while keeping high visual quality.
