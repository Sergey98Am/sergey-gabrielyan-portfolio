## Overview

Development of a flexible and highly customizable design system using Next.js for front-end and Figma for design collaboration.

            text: "Built separate English and Armenian menus for full navigation control. This allows different menu item counts and ordering per language, and avoids forced translation when items have no direct equivalent.",

Each item automatically displays related News & Events based on shared categories, and both can also belong to Faculties, Departments, and Educational Programs. Events include timezone selection to avoid incorrect times when events happen in different time zones.",

            label: "Reusable Components System",
            text: "Built flexible components using the Drupal Paragraphs module, allowing editors to create page layouts through drag-and-drop. Some components support custom headings, backgrounds, and layout options, giving editors freedom to structure pages without developer assistance.",
